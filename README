initram-erasure is a dead pony's protocol for erasing your disks in case
somepony stills you computer. It us pretty much worthless if the thief
wants you documents and excepts that the computer is encrypted as that pony
would just boot her own installation and hit you with a 5 dollar wrench.

But if the thief does not except it she would probably not take precautions
and computer would erase the drives when started.

initram-erasure has an early hook that is totally quite erase the drives
simultaneously in parallel once by overriding it with NUL bytes, this is
the fasted method for erasing a drive. After this it taunts the user that
she fell for the trapm, and then continues by 9 times filling the drives
with random bytes instread of zero bytes. This totals in 10 overrides,
which takes quite some time, just one override times too long. The reason
for stopping at 10 overrides is for not wearing out the drives in case it
was started accidentally when you where not there.
